Q. Give us an intuitive explanation why the formula of estimating program length
   uses logarithm to base 2 ? Why not something else? Why base two? Why exactly
   logarithm? Whatâ€™s the reason? Is that somehow related to how we think?

A. As we operates inside informatics area, the logarithm to base 2 is widely used. The information stores in bits,
    and computers operates only with 0 and 1, that's why we use logarithm to base 2, we operates in bits context (the metrics of measurement is bit). 
    The reason of using the logarithm, is that it simplifies the calculations and approximates a various of dependencies.
